## Scraping

For text analysis, whether online or following document OCR, few tools are as useful for pulling
out strings that represent a value than "regular expressions".

RegEx is a very flexible, and very fast, program for finding bits of text within
a document that has particular features defined as a "pattern".

| Pattern      | String with <span style="color:red;">match</span>                                    |
|--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subject:.\*  | <span style="color:red;">Subject: Re: TPS Reports</span>                             |
| \\$[0-9,]+   | The ransom of <span style="color:red;">$1,000,000</span> to Dr. Evil.                |
| \b\S+@\S+\b  | E-mail <span style="color:red;">info@sesync.org</span> or tweet @SESYNC for details! |

Specifying these patterns correctly can be tricky.  You can test out regex patterns [here](https://regex101.com/).  

===

Note that "\" must be escaped in R, so the third pattern does not look very
nice in a R string.

```{r, handout = 0}
library(stringr)

str_extract_all(
  'Email info@sesync.org or tweet @SESYNC for details!',
  '\\b\\S+@\\S+\\b')
```

===

Continuing with the Enron emails theme, begin by collecting the documents for
analysis with the **tm** package.

```{r, message=FALSE, handout = 0}
library(tm)

enron <- VCorpus(DirSource("data/enron"))
email <- enron[[1]]
```

```{r}
meta(email)
```

===

```{r}
content(email)
```

===

The RegEx pattern `^From: .*` matches any whole line that begins with "From: ".
Parentheses cause parts of the match to be captured for substitution or
extraction.

```{r, handout = 0}
match <- str_match(content(email), '^From: (.*)')
head(match)
```

===

## Data Extraction

The `meta` object for each e-mail was sparsely populated, but some of those
variables can be extracted from the `content`.

===

```{r, handout = 0}
enron <- tm_map(enron, function(email) {
  body <- content(email)
  match <- str_match(body, '^From: (.*)')
  match <- na.omit(match)
  meta(email, 'author') <- match[[1, 2]]
  return(email)
})
```

```{r}
email <- enron[[1]]
meta(email)
```

===

## Exercise 1

Now that you've learned a bit about extracting strings, try using regex to extract 
money values from the e-mail body content.
