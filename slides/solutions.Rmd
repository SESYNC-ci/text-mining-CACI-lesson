### Solution 2

```{r, handout = 0}
ggplot(words, aes(x = total)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

The frequency of some words isn't very informative.  You can filter by term or by total number of occurrences. 

```{r, handout = 0}
words_trim <- filter(words, total < 250)

ggplot(words_trim, aes(x = total)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

### Solution 3

```{r, handout = 0}
word_assoc <- findAssocs(dtm_trimmed, 'pipelin', 0.6)
word_assoc <- data.frame(
  word = names(word_assoc[[1]]),
  assoc = word_assoc,
  row.names = NULL)
```

```{r, handout = 0}
ggplot(word_assoc,
       aes(label = word, size = pipelin)) +
       geom_text_wordcloud_area()
```
