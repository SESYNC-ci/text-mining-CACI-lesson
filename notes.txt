tm - Text Mining package installs on macOS Okay

RQDQ - doesn't install okay on macOS, should on Windows (not tested)?
 - on mac
   - install.packages("RGtk2", dependencies = T, type = 'mac.binary.mavericks')
   - brew install gtk+
   - meh, nope
   
   
focus on tm and clustering

BagOfWords - corpus as matrix of term frequency

What about NLP


Want to distinguish data collection from our workflow stack


data organization
data manipulating
vizualization

... it's not really modeling or learning.

so a reasonable viz from "multivariate" data is? or for graph data is?
what is the fundamentally different data structure that comes from unstructured data.

tabular data
observations are made of discrete, pre-defined variables

unstructure data
obervations (texts) have not been made into variables yet, and unclear how to classify them

models for structuring unstructured texts
 - bag of words/n-grams
 - ?

coding is the process of counting frequency of themes


more general topics for handling multivariate data (that often comes from text mining)
categorical data
dimensionality reduction


could imagein a lesson on "computer assisted data collection", which includes using API's for tabular (structured) data, as well as "digitizing" unstructured data

http://www.sherpasoftware.com/blog/structured-and-unstructured-data-what-is-it/

use e-mails as example of distinguishing structured (but needing some assistance to collect, and unstructured), it's the unidentified variables part that makes it so hard
- how many variables? and what is their type?

want to distinguish qualitative from unstructured, if there is one
 - example of "How do you feel?"
   - if there were check boxes, it's a factor
   - if it's open-ended, but someone categorizes it, it's a factor
   - it if's open-ended, and uncategorized it's "qualitative", but not really necessarilly unstructured, it's a character column in my data frame <- it didn't measure/identify anything
 - example of "Pick a random number?", is it quantitative
   - it's clearly numerical, but the open-ended survey was clearly "character"
   - did it measure something pre-defined? maybe that's the question we're getting at.

and then what about relationed data, graph data... what's that?
 - meh, just an association table that references the main table twice

pattern recognition
 - different from pattern matching, the recognition means finding a pattern you didn't previously know

Mary's Collab Qual Analysis Site
- Process Tracing
- Measurement diagram in Cox 2015
  - ratio, interval, ordinal, categorical, qualitative
- Cox 2015
  - Analysis is the process of describing and then making inferences based on a set of data. To make an inference means to combine data with something else, say a set of assumptions or theories or more general knowledge, and draw a conclusion that goes beyond what the data themselves present.


i feel like there's something wrong with "tidy data"
think of the NASS data, the epitomy of long, there's only one variable per record, the rest is "context/metadata" for that variable. this is different from the idea of one observational unit per record.

categorical data becomes less useful when your sample size approaches the number of cateogries.
if qualitative data has an infinite number of cateogries ... what do you do. had some thought about connection to case studies, but it's gone.


how can R help with qualitative analysis (not data)?
- interface with storage/database (RQDA, tm, RMongo)
- text pattern searching - regex


documents rather than tables for unstructured information



Enron e-mails story
concept: corrupt individual
can you operationalize that in a way that you can't measure it

remember, measuring is equivalent to getting data


Qualitative

- Surveys
  - Check boxes
    - discrete
    - easy to analyze
  - Interviews
    -


Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis (CAQDA)

Coding
: Marking sections of a transcript that match a category.
: Might make the variable "number of references to theme"
  - for concept "Addresses Conflict", operationalize (interval) variable as #of text segments dealing with conflict
