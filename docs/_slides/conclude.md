## Analysis of Qualitative Data

Methods of analysis for qualitative data -- as defined in this lesson -- fall outside the scope of machine learning tools we are familiar with. In the future, we hope to address vizualization tools for qualitative data and are learning about relavant analytical methods.

> "Analysis is the process of describing and then making inferences based on a set of data. To make an inference means to combine data with something else, say a set of assumptions or theories or more general knowledge, and draw a conclusion that goes beyond what the data themselves present." ~ Cox, M. 2015.
